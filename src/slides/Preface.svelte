    unique space in the world of IT. They are expected to know the
    technologies and software platforms on which their organizations run as
    well as the businesses that they serve. A great software architect needs
    to master both sides of the architect's coin: business and technology.
    This is no small challenge, and it's why this book was created.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know</em></span>
    provides advice from software architects around the world on everything
    from how to avoid common pitfalls to how to build talented teams. It's a
    smorgasbord of advice from established software architects for other
    software architects or those who aspire to become software
    architects.</p><p>It's my sincere hope that this book will be a source of inspiration
    and guidance for software professionals everywhere. It's also my hope that
    software architects will use this book and its sister website to share
    advice and insights into what is perhaps the most challenging profession
    in information technology today.</p><p>This book is probably completely different from any other book
    you've read. It is the combined work of more than four dozen authors, all
    of whom donated their thoughts and advice about software architecture
    without compensation. It is, in a way, an open source book in the truest
    sense. Each author wrote his or her own contributions, those contributions
    were examined and edited with the author, and then the best contributions
    were chosen for publication. That's not much different than an open source
    software project where individuals contribute code rather than knowledge
    and wisdom.</p><div class="sect1" title="Permissions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="permissions"/>Permissions</h1></div></div></div><p>The licensing of each axiom is also similar to open source. Every
      contribution is freely available online and licensed under Creative
      Commons, Attribution 3, which means that you can use the individual
      contributions in your own work as long as you give credit to the
      original author. Other open source books have been tried and have, with
      only a few exceptions, failed. I believe that is because it's harder for
      individuals to contribute to a project unless it can be modularized.
      This book succeeds for exactly that reason: it is modularized. Each
      contribution is self-contained and works both in this larger collection
      and on its own.</p></div></div></p>
