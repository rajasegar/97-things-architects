				<Head2>YOU MIGHT ADOPT THE APPROACH</Head2>
				<ul>
						<li> A framework well designed</li>
						<li>An architecture carefully considered & cleverly implemented</li>
				</ul>
				<p> Will lend itself to <span class="text-yellow-500 font-bold">reuse</span> within your organization</p>

		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<Head2>The truth</Head2>
				<p>Even the most <span class="italic font-bold">Beautiful, Elegant, Reusable</span>
</p>
				<p>architecture, framework or system will only be reused by people who:</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Know It's there</li>
						<li>Know How to use it</li>
						<li>Are convinced that it is better than doing it themselves</li>
				</ul>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>Within an organization, developers or designers</p>
				<Head2>Need to know</Head2>
				<p>that a design, framework, library,
						or fragment of code exists</p>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>Where they can find all the</p>
				<Head2>Critical information</Head2>
				<ul>
						<li>Documentation</li>
						<li>Versions</li>
						<li>Compatibility</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In order to reuse them</p>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<Head2>Simple, Logical truth</Head2>
				<p>People won't look for things that they don't believe exist</p>
		</Slide>

		<Slide>
				<p>You are more likely to succeed with reusable elements if the</p>
				<Head2>Information about them is "pushed"</Head2>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<Head2>Any number of methods for pushing information</Head2>
				<p>about reusable elements in an organization</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Wiki pages with an RSS feed providing update information</li>
						<li>Email announcing version updates in the source repository</li>
						<li>In a tiny team => Designer or Lead Dev can inform his colleagues in personal converstations</li>
				</ul>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>Ultimately, whatever your process  for communicating  about reusable elements</p>
				<Head2>Make sure you have one</Head2>
				<h3>don't leave it up to chance</h3>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<h1>Understanding</h1>
				<p>how to reuse an element depends on</p>
				<ul>
						<li>Skills </li>
						<li> Training</li>
				</ul>

		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>Ofcourse there are those people who</p>
				<Head2>resonate</Head2>
				<p>with coding and design</p>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>We have all worked with them</p>
				<p>The Gifted Developers and Architects</p>
				<Head3>Speed and depth of understanding</Head3>
				<p>is impressive, even scary</p>
				<p>But these people are rare</p>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<Head2>The rest of your team</Head2>
				<p>might be made up of</p>
				<Head3>good, solid, intelligent </Head3>
				<h4>developers and designers</h4>
						<p>They need to be taught.</p>

		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>Developers and designers</p>
				<Head3>Might now know or fully understand</Head3>
				<ul>
						<li>of the particular design pattern used in a design</li>
						<li>the inheritance model</li>
						<p> The framework designer intended them to use</p>

		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>They need to be given </p>
				<Head3>easy access to that information </Head3>
				<p>in the form of </p>
				<ul>
						<li>up-to-date documentation,</li>
						<li>or even better, training</li>
				</ul>

		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<Head3>A little training goes a long way</Head3>
				<p>toward ensuring that everyone is on the same page when it comes to reuse</p>
		</Slide>

		<Slide>
				<p>People, and particularly developers,</p>
				<Head3>tend to prefer to solve problems themselves </Head3>
				<p>rather than ask for help. </p>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
		<p>Asking how something works is </p>
		<Head3>a sign of weakness, or even an indication of ignorance.</Head3>

		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>This has a lot to do with the </p>
				<Head2>maturity and personality type </Head2>
				<p>of your individual team members</p>

						
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<Head2>better than doing it themselves</Head2>
				<p>means different things to different people</p>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<Head2>Young guns</Head2>
				<p>on your team will always want to write things themselves because it </p>
				<h4>appeases their egos</h4>

		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<Head2>More experienced people</Head2>
				<p>more likely to accept that</p>
						<ul>
								<li>someone else has given thought to the problem domain </li>
								<li> has something to offer in terms of a solution.</li>
						</ul>
		</Slide>
		<Slide>
				<p>If your team doesn't know </p>
				<Head3>where to find reusable artifacts or how to reuse them, </Head3>
				<p>they will default to the natural, human position:</p>
						<h4>they will build it themselves.</h4>
						<h4 class="text-yellow-500"> And you will pay for it.</h4>

				<Head2>Is About People and Education</Head2>
