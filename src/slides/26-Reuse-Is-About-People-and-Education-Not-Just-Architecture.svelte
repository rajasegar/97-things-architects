    a framework that is well designed, or an architecture that is carefully
    considered and cleverly implemented, will lend itself to reuse within your
    organization. The truth is that even the most beautiful, elegant, and
    reusable architecture, framework, or system will only be reused by people
    who:<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0101"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0102"/></p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="know_it_apostrophy_s_there-id1"/></h1></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Know It's There"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="know_it_apostrophy_s_there"/>Know It's There</h2></div></div></div><p>Within your organization, developers or designers need to know
        that a design, framework, library, or fragment of code exists, and
        where they can find all the critical information about these elements
        (e.g., documentation, versions, and compatibility) in order to reuse
        them. It is a simple, logical truth that people won't look for things
        that they don't believe exist. You are more likely to succeed with
        reusable elements if the information about them is "pushed."<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0103"/></p><p>There are any number of methods for pushing information about
        reusable elements in an organization. These range from wiki pages with
        an RSS feed providing update information, useful in very large teams,
        to email announcing version updates in the source repository. In a
        tiny team, the designer or lead developer can inform his colleagues in
        personal conversations or by shouting it across the office.
        Ultimately, whatever your process for communicating about reusable
        elements, make sure you have one—don't leave it up to chance.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Know How to Use It"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="know_how_to_use_it"/>Know How to Use It</h2></div></div></div><p>Understanding how to reuse an element depends on skills and
        training. Of course there are those people who (to use Donald Knuth's
        terminology) "resonate" with coding and design. We have all worked
        with them, the gifted developers and architects whose speed and depth
        of understanding is impressive, even scary. But these people are rare.
        The rest of your team might be made up of good, solid, intelligent
        developers and designers. They need to be taught.</p><p>Developers and designers might not know of the particular design
        pattern used in a design, or fully understand the inheritance model
        that the framework designer intended them to use. They need to be
        given easy access to that information in the form of up-to-date
        documentation, or even better, training. A little training goes a long
        way toward ensuring that everyone is on the same page when it comes to
        reuse.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Are Convinced That It's Better Than Doing It Themselves"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="are_convinced_that_it_apostrophy_s_bet"/>Are Convinced That It's Better Than Doing It Themselves</h2></div></div></div><p>People, and particularly developers, tend to prefer to solve
        problems themselves rather than ask for help. Asking how something
        works is a sign of weakness, or even an indication of ignorance. This
        has a lot to do with the maturity and personality type of your
        individual team members; "better than doing it themselves" means
        different things to different people. The "young guns" on your team
        will always want to write things themselves because it appeases their
        egos, whereas your more experienced people are more likely to accept
        that someone else has given thought to the problem domain and has
        something to offer in terms of a solution.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0104"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0105"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0106"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0107"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0108"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0109"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0110"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0111"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0112"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-CHP-26-0113"/></p><p>If your team doesn't know where to find reusable artifacts or
        how to reuse them, they will default to the natural, human position:
        they will build it themselves. And you will pay for it.</p></div></div></div></p>
