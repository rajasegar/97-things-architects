      Know</em></span> was not conceived in a vacuum. There are many people who
      deserve credit for the idea and execution. In order, I would like to
      thank Jay Zimmerman, who suggested that I do a presentation for the No
      Fluff, Just Stuff symposiums called "10 Things Every Software Architect
      Should Know"; Bruce Eckel, for managing the mailing list on which the
      idea for this book was germinated; Jeremy Meyer, for suggesting that I
      create a book out of what was going to be a simple slide show; Nitin
      Borwankar, who suggested doing a public wiki so that everyone can be
      involved; and the members of Bruce's mailing list who, on nothing more
      than a promise, chose to donate their time and contribute the first
      axioms to this book. I also want to thank the dozens of software
      architects who worked hard to contribute to this book but whose
      contributions are not included. It was extremely hard to choose which
      axioms should be a part of this work. I'm deeply grateful to everyone
      who contributed content, whether it was included or not.<a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0001"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0002"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0003"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0004"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0005"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0006"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0007"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0008"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0009"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0010"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0011"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0012"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0013"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0014"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0015"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0016"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0017"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0018"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0019"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0020"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0021"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0022"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0023"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0024"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0025"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0026"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0027"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0028"/><a class="indexterm" id="IDX-PREFACE-0029"/></p><p>O'Reilly deserves credit as well for listening to this idea with
      open ears and backing what is more or less an untested method of
      creating a book. O'Reilly also deserves credit for agreeing that all
      content will be open source (Creative Commons, Attribution 3) and that
      the content will be available for free to anyone on the website. People
      at O'Reilly I would like to thank specifically include Mike Loukides,
      Mike Hendrickson, Laura Painter, and Laurel Ackerman. Without your help
      and guidance, this project would not be possible.</p><p>We (O'Reilly and I) are developing other "97 Things" projects. The
      idea is to create a new and unique series that leverages the
      collaborative intelligence of experts in every field that is practical.
      Project management, software development, and data architecture are just
      a few of the other topics we are already pursuing.</p><p>I hope you will find the contents of this book inspiring and that
      you will be inspired to contribute your own axioms to future
      projects!</p><p>All the best!</p><p>â€”Richard Monson-Haefel</p><p>Series Editor, 97 Things</p></div></p>
